            <p> I am a consultant at DXC who works with Microsoft Dyanmics, an Enterprise Resource Planning and Customer 
                Relationship Management platform. I focus on the business side, interacting with the client and helping them 
                design solutions that work for them and that we can build. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I have an interest in artifical intelligence,but never learned the technical skills required to use machine learning. 
                I joined this coding bootcamp to help me get a foot in the door to follow my dreams. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not working, I enjoy going to concerts. I love many types of music, ranging from 80s Rock to EDM to Indie. 
                Despite this I have no actual muscial talent. I also enjoy traveling, dancing, and have a lifelong love of all things 
                space related.
